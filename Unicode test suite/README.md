## What is it?

This is suite of files that old Wikipedia editors once used to take screenshots demonstrating the capabilities of various apps. The file names are in the same language as the contents.

This license gives you vast freedom to do as you like with them, but with only the attribution and the share-alike requirements that you need to fulfill. This does not mean that you cannot use them in a commercial product. All you have to do is to put them in a dedicate subfolder, add a `readme` and `license` file in that folder that gives due credits, and notify the user during the installation.

That's as far as the copyright laws go. These logos, as well as the name "Wikipedia", however, are the trademarks of the Wikimedia foundation. As long as you don't use them in a trade name or logo of your own, you should be okay.
