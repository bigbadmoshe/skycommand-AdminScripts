# Unicode test suite

## What is it?

This suite consists of files that use a wide range of Unicode characters in their names. Old Wikipedia editors once used this suite to take screenshots demonstrating the capabilities of various apps. The file names are in the same language as the contents.

This suite represents a widespread Unicode use case that does not consist of some arbitrary Unicode characters. The Unicode strings used in the file names have been in front of two billion Internet users for one and half a decade. They are the most peer-reviewed pieces of Unicode strings in the world.
